The scatterplot shows a subtle negative relationship between balance score (lower = more balanced) and average rating, while the density plot indicates that high-rated recipes are somewhat more concentrated toward lower balance scores. Overall, this suggests that nutritional balance may modestly influence user preferences, though other factors like flavor or cuisine likely play a larger role.",

This suggests that while many players of both sexes achieve moderate ratings, men are more represented among the very high-rated players.\nCode# 2. Number of games played by sex\nggplot(fide_all, aes(x = sex, y = games, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +  # log scale if games vary a lot\n  labs(title = \"Number of Games Played by Sex\",\n       x = \"Sex\",\n       y = \"Number of Games (log scale)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nNumber of Games Played by Sex The boxplot of games played reveals that male players generally have more games under their belt than female players. This difference in experience could partially explain the gap seen in the higher rating ranges, as more games can provide greater opportunities for skill development and rating improvement.\nCode# 3.

Male players dominate the highest rating positions, though several female players are also represented among top performers. This chart emphasizes the exceptional skill of top female players while illustrating the ongoing imbalance in representation.\nCode# 4. Scatterplot: Rating vs. Games, colored by sex\nggplot(fide_all, aes(x = games, y = rating, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_log10() +  # log scale for games\n  labs(title = \"Chess Rating vs. Number of Games Played\",\n       x = \"Number of Games (log scale)\",\n       y = \"FIDE Rating\",\n       color = \"Sex\") +\n  theme_minimal()\nRating vs. Games Played The scatterplot of rating versus number of games played indicates a positive trend: players with more games tend to have higher ratings, regardless of sex. However, the spread suggests that experience alone does not fully account for rating differences; some players achieve high ratings with relatively fewer games. The pattern is similar for both sexes, though the density of points suggests more male players populate the upper-right corner (high games, high ratings).\nOverall Interpretation The visualizations collectively tell a story about both skill and participation differences between male and female chess players. While most players cluster in similar rating ranges, male players are overrepresented among the highest ratings and the most experienced players. Nevertheless, the data also highlights the strong performance of female players, suggesting that when given opportunities to play more games, female players can achieve competitive ratings comparable to male peers. This analysis points to both structural factors (experience/opportunity) and performance potential as key elements in understanding rating differences by sex.",

Early in the period, men consistently received more awards, but over time, the gap narrowed and then flipped in recent decades, women now win as frequently or more often than men. Notably, from around 2005 onward, women’s representation increased steadily while men’s declined, suggesting a broader shift toward gender balance in the literary world. The emergence of non-binary and trans winners—although in small numbers—also signals that prizes are slowly becoming more inclusive of diverse gender identities, reflecting changing social awareness. The second visualization illustrates the ethnic composition of prize winners over time. White British and Non-UK White authors still make up a large majority of winners—over half of all recipients in every decade—but there’s a gradual diversification trend. From 1990 to 2020, representation of Black British, Caribbean, Asian, and Jewish authors increased slightly, and the share of White British authors declined. Although progress is visible, the overall pattern shows that literary prizes still reflect systemic inequities in cultural visibility, with only incremental movement toward racial diversity. The third chart highlights how gender balance varies across genres. Women dominate children’s literature (71%) and fiction (62%), but are underrepresented in science fiction & fantasy (21%), non-fiction (32%), and crime writing (37%). This distribution underscores how certain genres remain gendered spaces—with women more visible in traditionally “feminine” genres and men continuing to hold space in others. It’s also worth noting that middle-ground genres like poetry, drama, and biography hover around parity, showing potential for balanced recognition. Together, these visuals show that the literary prize landscape is becoming more inclusive but not yet equitable. Gender representation has improved dramatically, while racial and ethnic diversity is advancing slowly. Genre patterns suggest that institutional change interacts with cultural norms, even as new identities gain visibility, older hierarchies still shape who gets recognized and for what kinds of work.",

Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs.

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the “sf” and “data.frame” classes:\n\nCodeclass(nc)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_cities)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_water)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhen we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with st_crs() from the sf package:\n\nCodest_crs(nc)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD27 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD27\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1927\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.978698213898,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4267]]\n\n\nWe can treat sf objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using ggplot2 to make spatial visualizations:\n\nCodeggplot(nc) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(title = \"NAD27\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange CRS\n\nLet’s explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The st_transform() function in sf re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The crs argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via https://epsg.io. In the example below, I searched for “South Carolina”.\n\n\nCodenc_transformed &lt;- nc |&gt; st_transform(crs = \"EPSG:32133\")\nst_crs(nc_transformed)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:32133 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"NAD83 / South Carolina\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"NAD83\",\n        DATUM[\"North American Datum 1983\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"GRS 1980\",6378137,298.257222101,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4269]],\n    CONVERSION[\"SPCS83 South Carolina zone (meter)\",\n        METHOD[\"Lambert Conic Conformal (2SP)\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of false origin\",31.8333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8821]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of false origin\",-81,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8822]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 1st standard parallel\",34.8333333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8823]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of 2nd standard parallel\",32.5,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8824]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Easting at false origin\",609600,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8826]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Northing at false origin\",0,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8827]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"easting (X)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"northing (Y)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"United States (USA) - South Carolina - counties of Abbeville; Aiken; Allendale; Anderson; Bamberg; Barnwell; Beaufort; Berkeley; Calhoun; Charleston; Cherokee; Chester; Chesterfield; Clarendon; Colleton; Darlington; Dillon; Dorchester; Edgefield; Fairfield; Florence; Georgetown; Greenville; Greenwood; Hampton; Horry; Jasper; Kershaw; Lancaster; Laurens; Lee; Lexington; Marion; Marlboro; McCormick; Newberry; Oconee; Orangeburg; Pickens; Richland; Saluda; Spartanburg; Sumter; Union; Williamsburg; York.\"],\n        BBOX[32.05,-83.36,35.21,-78.52]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",32133]]\n\nCodeggplot(nc_transformed) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to use https://epsg.io to find two CRSs that result in a North Carolina map that is noticeably different from the original in the NAD27 CRS.\nTake a look at the function below that re-maps a spatial object using a new CRS.\n\nRead through the function to get a sense for how this code works.\n\nspatial_obj and new_crs are called arguments (function inputs).\n\nAdd one more argument called title to this function.

Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the scale_color_viridis_c() documentation via the ggplot2 reference.\n\nRead the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?\nLook through the examples section. What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n  # Elevation raster background\n  geom_raster(\n    data = elev_df,\n    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    name = \"Elevation (m)\",\n    low = \"darkgreen\",   # lowest elevations\n    high = \"white\"       # highest elevations\n  ) +\n  \n  # County outlines (no fill so raster shows through)\n  geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  # Cities with population &gt;= 10,000\n  geom_sf(\n    data = mn_cities |&gt; dplyr::filter(Population &gt;= 10000),\n    mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  \n  # Title + theme\n  labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") +\n  ggthemes::theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodeseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties |&gt; st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCodepng(filename = \"../figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 500, height = 500)\nggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend \ndev.off()",

We can combine logical objects with & (and) and | (or).\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nx &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\nCode!(x &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nCodex &lt; 2 | x &gt; 8\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can summarize logical vectors with:\n\n\nany(): Are ANY of the values TRUE?\n\nall(): Are ALL of the values TRUE?\n\nsum(): How many of the values are TRUE?\n\nmean(): What fraction of the values are TRUE?\n\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nany(x == 1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodeall(x &lt; 10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodesum(x == 1)\n\n[1] 1\n\nCodemean(x == 1)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n\nif_else() and case_when() are functions that allow you to return values depending on the value of a logical vector. You’ll explore the documentation for these in the following exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: ifelse() (from base R) and if_else() (from tidyverse) are different functions. We prefer if_else() for many reasons (examples below).\n\nNoisy to make sure you catch issues/bugs\nCan explicitly handle missing values\nKeeps dates as dates\n\n\nExamples\n\nCodex &lt;- c(-1, -2, 4, 9, NA)\n\nifelse(x &gt; 0, 'positive', 'negative')\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"positive\" \"positive\" NA        \n\nCodeif_else(x &gt; 0, 'positive', 'negative')\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"positive\" \"positive\" NA        \n\nCodeifelse(x &gt; 0, 1, 'negative') # Bad: doesn't complain with combo of data types\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"1\"        \"1\"        NA        \n\nCodeif_else(x &gt; 0, 1, 'negative') # Good:noisy to make sure you catch issues\n\nError in `if_else()`:\n!

    "text": "Factors\nNotes\nCreating factors\nIn R, factors are made up of two components: the actual values of the data and the possible levels within the factor. Creating a factor requires supplying both pieces of information.\n\nCodemonths &lt;- c(\"Mar\", \"Dec\", \"Jan\",  \"Apr\", \"Jul\")\n\n\nHowever, if we were to sort this vector, R would sort this vector alphabetically.\n\nCode# alphabetical sort\nsort(months)\n\n[1] \"Apr\" \"Dec\" \"Jan\" \"Jul\" \"Mar\"\n\n\nWe can fix this sorting by creating a factor version of months. The levels argument is a character vector that specifies the unique values that the factor can take. The order of the values in levels defines the sorting of the factor.\n\nCodemonths_fct &lt;- factor(months, levels = month.abb) # month.abb is a built-in variable\nmonths_fct\n\n[1] Mar Dec Jan Apr Jul\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nCodesort(months_fct)\n\n[1] Jan Mar Apr Jul Dec\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nWhat if we try to create a factor with values that aren’t in the levels?

Implicit Missing Data\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit missing data is data that is explicitly marked as missing. In R, this is done with NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplicit missing data is data that is missing but not explicitly marked as such.\n\n\n\n\n\n- This can happen when an entire row is missing from a dataset.\n\n\n- For example, if a study participant doesn’t attend a follow-up visit. It maybe not even be recorded in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to make implicit missingness explicit before we can work with the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Consider the combinations of variables that you’d expect to be fully present in a complete dataset.\n\n\n- If a combination is missing, you can create a new row with explicit missing values.\n\n\n- For example, if you expect every participant (each has a unique pid) to have an observation for each visit, you could use the function complete() to create that new row and plug in values of NA for the missing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n# study_data_full &lt;- study_data |&gt;  #   complete(pid, visit) #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Dealing with missing data\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have explicit missing data, there are 3 main ways of proceeding:\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Drop the cases or rows with any missing data from the analysis–a complete case analysis\n\n\n- Pro: Easy to implement\n\n\n- Con: reduces sample size, introduces bias if the missing data is not “missing completely at random”\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a category for missing values.\n\n\n- Example: The survey question “What is your gender?” might only provide two possible responses: “male” and “female”. Missing values for this could indicate that the respondent uses a non-binary designation. Instead of dropping these cases, treating the missing data as its own category (“Does not wish to answer”) would be more appropriate.\n\n\n- Pros: Maintains sample size, may help us if data is “missing not at random”\n\n\n- Cons: Not directly applicable to continuous outcomes (could include interactions with a categorical version in models to account for it)\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Impute (or fill in values for) the missing data using imputation algorithms.\n\n\n- Imputation algorithms can be as simple as replacing missing values with the mean of the non-missing values (very simplistic).\n\n\n- Regression imputation algorithms use models to predict missing values as a function of other variables in the data.\n\n\n- Pros: Maintains sample size, multiple regression imputation minimizes bias if “missing at random”\n\n\n- Cons: Computationally intensive\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding between these options and proceeding with choosing finer details within an option requires an understanding of the mechanism by which data become missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Missing Data Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons for which a variable might have missing data are divided into 3 mechanisms: MCAR, MAR, and MNAR.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a dataset, multiple mechanisms may be present–we need to consider the missingness mechanism for each variable individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n- Missing completely at random (MCAR):\n\n\n- The probability of missing data for a variable is the same for all cases. Implies that causes of the missing data are unrelated to the data. (https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html)\n\n\n- Examples:\n\n\n- Measurement device that runs out of batteries causes the remainder of observations for the day to be missing.\n\n\n- Data entry software requires a particular field to be typo-free, and missing values are introduced when there are typos.\n\n\n- Implications for downstream work:\n\n\n- If a variable has MCAR missingness, a complete case analysis will be unbiased (still valid).\n\n\n- However, with a lot of missing observations, a complete case analysis will suffer from loss of statistical power (ability to detect a real difference), and imputation will be useful to retain the original sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Missing at random (MAR):\n\n\n- The probability of missing data is related to observed variables but unrelated to unobserved information.\n\n\n- Examples:\n\n\n- Blood pressure measurements tend to be missing in patients in worse health. (Those in worse health are more likely to miss clinic visits.) Better and worse health can be measured by a variety of indicators in their health record.\n\n\n- In a survey, older people are more likely to report their income than younger people. Missingness is related to the observed age variable, but not to unobserved information.\n\n\n- Implications for downstream work:\n\n\n- Try to use imputation methods that predict the value of the missing variables from other observed variables. Assessing whether this can be done accurately takes some exploration–we’ll explore this shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Missing not at random (MNAR):\n\n\n- The probability of missing data is related to unobserved variables (and probably observed variables too).\n\n\n- Examples:\n\n\n- Blood pressure measurements are more likely to be missing for those with the highest blood pressure. This is MNAR rather than MAR because the missing data on blood pressure is related to the unobserved values themselves.\n\n\n- High-income individuals may be less likely to report their income.\n\n\n- Implications for downstream work:\n\n\n- Ideally, we would learn more about the causes for the missingness. This could allow us to use more informed imputation models.\n\n\n- Example: Biological measurements that tend to be missing because of concentrations that are too low (a phenomenon known as left-censoring). Imputation methods specifically suited to left-censoring are useful here.\n\n\n- We can use imputation methods with different assumptions about the missing data and try out a variety of assumptions. This lets us see how sensitive the results are under various scenarios.\n\n\n- Example: If higher incomes are more likely to be missing, we can make different assumptions about what “high” could be to fill in the missing values and see how our results change under these different assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Missing data mechanism For each of the following situations, propose what missing data mechanism you think is most likely at play.\n\n\na. In a clinical trial, some patients dropped out before the end of the study. Their reasons for dropping out were not recorded.\n\n\nMNAR probably: The chance of missingness is likely due to factors that aren’t recorded (like discomfort).\n\n\nb. A weather station records temperature, humidity, and wind speed every hour. Some of the recorded values are missing.\n\n\nCould be MCAR if the missing values are from technical glitches. Could be MAR if the missing values are related to other measured weather variables. Could be MNAR if the values tend to be missing when the values themselves are high (e.g., high temperature, humidity, and wind speed causing measurement devices to malfunction).\n\n\nc. A social media platform collects data on user interactions, such as likes, comments, and shares. Some interactions are not recorded due to bugs in the code.\n\n\nCould be MCAR if the bugs affected the platform uniformly. Could be MAR if the bugs affected groups of users differently, but where the groupings are known (e.g., bugs affect mobile users more and mobile vs. desktop usage is measurable). Could be MNAR if the bugs lead to performance issues that affect users with slower internet more (where internet speed is likely not measured).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exploring Missing Data\n\n\n\n\n\nGuiding question: How can we use visualizations and tabulations to explore what missing data mechanisms may be at play?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll look at the airquality dataset available in base R, which gives daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. You can pull up the codebook with ?airquality in the Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r load_airqual} # #| eval: true # data(airquality) #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Missingness by Variable\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can explore how much missingness there is for each variable with the following functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n{r miss_by_var} # #| eval: true # summary(airquality) # Summary statistics in addition to number of NA's # naniar::vis_miss(airquality) # Where are NA's located? # naniar::miss_var_summary(airquality) # Information from vis_miss() in table form #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Missingness by Case\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can explore how much missingness there is for each case with naniar::miss_case_summary().\n\n\nFor each case, this function calculates the number and percentage of variables with a missing value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of Information: If the pct_miss column is large for a case, we likely won’t be able to impute any of its missing values because there just isn’t enough known information–this case will have to be dropped from the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r miss_by_case} # #| eval: true # naniar::miss_case_summary(airquality) #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exploring Missingness Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing missingness mechanisms involves checking if missingness in a variable is related to other variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Through our available data, we are really only able to explore the potential for MCAR or MAR mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of Information: There is always the chance that unobserved information (unobserved other variables or unobserved values of the variables we do have) is related to missingness for our variables, so to think through the potential for MNAR, more contextual information is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore these relationships, we can create TRUE/FALSE indicators of whether a variable is missing. In the plots below, we use is.na(Ozone) to explore whether cases with missing ozone values are noticeably different from cases with observed ozone values in terms of Solar.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r miss_box_dens} # library(ggplot2) # #| eval: true # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = is.na(Ozone), y = Solar.R)) +  #     geom_boxplot() # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Solar.R, color = is.na(Ozone))) +  #     geom_density() #\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above boxplots and density plots suggest that missing ozone is not strongly related to solar radiation levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still should check if ozone missingness is related to the Wind, Temp, Month, and Day variables (to be done in Exercises).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to checking if the chance of ozone missingness is related to Solar.R, we should check if the values of ozone could be predicted by Solar.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the scaterrplot below, we look at the relationship between Ozone and Solar.R and use vertical lines to indicate the Solar.R values for cases that are missing Ozone.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Impact of Information: We see that missing Ozone cases are within the observed span of Solar.R, so we would be ok with predicting Ozone from Solar.R because there would be no extrapolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r miss_scatter_na_markers} # #| eval: true # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Solar.R, y = Ozone)) + #     geom_point() + #     geom_smooth() + #     geom_vline(data = airquality |&gt; filter(is.na(Ozone)), mapping = aes(xintercept = Solar.R)) #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

What concerns might arise from using a model to impute Ozone?\n\n\n\n\n\n{r miss_scatter_na_markers_alt} # library(readr) # library(tidyverse) # #| eval: true # #| echo: false # airquality_mod &lt;- airquality |&gt;  #     mutate( #         Solar.R_mod1 = if_else(is.na(Ozone), 250 + Solar.R/4, Solar.R), #         Solar.R_mod2 = if_else(is.na(Ozone), 250 + Solar.R/2, Solar.R) #     ) #  # ggplot(airquality_mod, aes(x = is.na(Ozone), y = Solar.R_mod1)) +  #     geom_boxplot() + #     labs(title = \"Alternate Situation 1\") # ggplot(airquality_mod, aes(x = Solar.R_mod1, y = Ozone)) + #     geom_point() + #     geom_smooth() + #     geom_vline(data = airquality_mod |&gt; filter(is.na(Ozone)), mapping = aes(xintercept = Solar.R_mod1)) + #     labs(title = \"Alternate Situation 1\") #  # ggplot(airquality_mod, aes(x = is.na(Ozone), y = Solar.R_mod2)) +  #     geom_boxplot() + #     labs(title = \"Alternate Situation 2\") # ggplot(airquality_mod, aes(x = Solar.R_mod2, y = Ozone)) + #     geom_point() + #     geom_smooth() + #     geom_vline(data = airquality_mod |&gt; filter(is.na(Ozone)), mapping = aes(xintercept = Solar.R_mod2)) + #     labs(title = \"Alternate Situation 2\") #\n\n\nOzone is missing when solar is at higher values for both alternative situations. In alt 1 version, we have some observed data in the range of Solar for where Ozone is missing so we could predict it fairly well. In alt 2 version, Ozone is missing when Solar is beyond the values of our observed data so we don’t have a good sense of what the relationship would be between Solar and Ozone.\n\n\n3. Ozone mechanism detection Continue the investigation of missingness for Ozone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to see how Month, Wind, and Temp relate to the chance of missingness for Ozone and to the value of Ozone.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it look like a linear regression model (perhaps with variable transformations) could be effective in imputing the missing ozone data?\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # ggplot(airquality, aes(fill = is.na(Ozone), x = factor(Month))) + #   geom_bar(position = \"fill\") #  # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = is.na(Ozone), y = Wind)) + #   geom_boxplot() #  # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = is.na(Ozone), y = Temp)) + #   geom_boxplot() #  # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = factor(Month), y = Ozone)) + #     geom_boxplot() #  # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Wind, y = Ozone)) + #   geom_point() + #   geom_smooth() + #   geom_vline(data = airquality |&gt; filter(is.na(Ozone)), mapping = aes(xintercept = Wind)) #  # ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + #     geom_point() + #     geom_smooth() + #     geom_vline(data = airquality |&gt; filter(is.na(Ozone)), mapping = aes(xintercept = Temp)) #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Regression Imputation\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a model is built and used to generate a single set of predictions for missing values, this is known as single imputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- When using singly imputed data in subsequent modeling, the uncertainty in estimates tends to be underestimated. This means that:\n\n\n- Standard errors are lower than they should be.\n\n\n- Confidence intervals won’t contain the true parameter value the “advertised” percentage of times\n\n\n- e.g., 95% confidence intervals will not contain the truth in 95% of samples–the coverage probability will be less than 95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn multiple imputation, multiple imputed datasets are generated with different values for the filled-in data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Subsequent models are fit on each of these datasets, and both estimates and uncertainty measures are pooled across all of these fits.\n\n\n- Multiple imputation more accurately estimates uncertainty measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Simulation Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a simulation study to investigate the statistical properties described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Generate (simulate) data where we are in control of missing data mechanisms and the true relationship between an outcome and the predictors.\n\n\n2. On that simulated data, use single imputation to fill in the missing values. Fit the desired model, and obtain a confidence interval for a coefficient of interest.\n\n\n3. On that simulated data, use multiple imputation to fill in the missing values. Fit the desired models on all imputed datasets, pool results, and obtain a confidence interval for a coefficient of interest.\n\n\n4. Steps 1 - 3 are repeated a lot of times (num_simulations &lt;- 1000) to see how things work out in lots of different samples.\n\n\n5. Summarize the performance of single and multiple imputation across the num_simulations simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will slowly step through the simulation study code below. We will pause frequently for you to add comments documenting what is happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r mult_single_sim_study} # set.seed(224) # num_simulations &lt;- 1000 # ci_list &lt;- vector(\"list\", length = num_simulations) #  # system.time({ # for (i in 1:num_simulations) { #     # Simulate data #     n &lt;- 1000 #     sim_data &lt;- tibble( #         x1 = runif(n, min = 0, max = 1), #         x2 = x1 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1), #         x2_miss_bool = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = x1/2), #         x2_NA = if_else(x2_miss_bool == 1, NA, x2), #         y = x1 + x2 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) #     ) #      #     # Single imputation --------------- #     mice_obj &lt;- mice(sim_data |&gt; select(x1, x2_NA, y), m = 1, method = \"norm\", printFlag = FALSE) #     si_mod &lt;- with(mice_obj, lm(y ~ x1 + x2_NA)) #     ci_single &lt;- si_mod$analyses[[1]] |&gt; confint(level = 0.95) #     ci_single &lt;- ci_single[\"x2_NA\",] #      #     # Multiple imputation ------------- #     mice_obj &lt;- mice(sim_data |&gt; select(x1, x2_NA, y), m = 10, method = \"norm\", printFlag = FALSE) #     mi_mods &lt;- with(mice_obj, lm(y ~ x1 + x2_NA)) #     pooled_res &lt;- pool(mi_mods) #     summ_pooled_res &lt;- summary(pooled_res, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) #     ci_multiple_lower &lt;- summ_pooled_res |&gt; filter(term==\"x2_NA\") |&gt; pull(`2.5 %`) #     ci_multiple_upper &lt;- summ_pooled_res |&gt; filter(term==\"x2_NA\") |&gt; pull(`97.5 %`) #      #     # Store CI information #     ci_list[[i]] &lt;- tibble( #         ci_lower = c( #             ci_single[1], #             ci_multiple_lower #         ), #         ci_upper = c( #             ci_single[2], #             ci_multiple_upper #         ), #         which_imp = c(\"single\", \"multiple\") #     ) # } # }) #\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we compute the confidence interval (CI) coverage probability (fraction of times the CI contains the true value of 1) for the CIs generated from single and multiple imputation:\n\n\n\n\n\n{r mult_single_sim_study_summ} # ci_data &lt;- bind_rows(ci_list) # ci_data |&gt;  #     mutate(contains_truth = ci_lower &lt; 1 & ci_upper &gt; 1) |&gt;  #     group_by(which_imp) |&gt;  #     summarize(frac_contains_truth = mean(contains_truth)) #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Done!\n\n\n\n\n\n- Check the ICA Instructions for how to (a) push your code to GitHub and (b) update your portfolio website",

    "text": "Functions and Control Structures\nWhy functions?\nGetting really good at writing useful and reusable functions is one of the best ways to increase your expertise in data science. It requires a lot of practice.\nIf you’ve copied and pasted code 3 or more times, it’s time to write a function. Try to avoid repeating yourself.\n\n\n\nReducing errors: Copy + paste + modify is prone to errors (e.g., forgetting to change a variable name)\n\nEfficiency: If you need to update code, you only need to do it one place. This allows reuse of code within and across projects.\n\nReadability: Encapsulating code within a function with a descriptive name makes code more readable.\n\n\nCore parts of a function\nWhen you define a function, what does it look like?\n\nCode# Defining a function\nfunction_name &lt;- function(input_name_1, input_name_2 = default_value_2){\n\n  # function body - code that does something\n\n  return(output)\n}\n\n# Calling a function (all valid ways)\nfunction_name(input_name_1 = 2, input_name_2 = 4)\nfunction_name(2, 4)\nfunction_name(input_name_2 = 4, input_name_1 = 2)\nfunction_name(2)\n\n\nThe core parts of defining a function include:\n\n\nfunction() directive\n\nThis is what allows tells R to create a function.\n\n\n\nArguments/Inputs: the input_name_1 and input_name_2 – these are names of the function inputs\n\n\ndefault_value_2 is a default value that is used if no input values are provided when the function is called\n\n\n\nFunction body\n\nThe code inside the curly braces { } is where all the work happens. This code uses the function arguments to perform computations.\n\n\n\nReturn value\n\nWe can explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().\n\n\n\nHere are three examples that can help us learn a few properties of functions:\n\nCodeaverage &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\naverage2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x))\n}\n\naverage3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n}\n\n\nNote:\n\nIn average2, the remove_nas argument has a default value of TRUE.\n\nWhen a function has default values for arguments, they don’t have to be provided when you call the function if you want to use the default value. See below:\n\nCode# Does throw an error\naverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\nError in average(c(1, 2, 3, NA)): argument \"remove_nas\" is missing, with no default\n\nCodeaverage(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = TRUE)\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCode# Doesn't throw an error\naverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA))\n\n[1] 1.5\n\nCodeaverage2(c(1, 2, 3, NA), remove_nas = FALSE)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nIf we don’t provide a return(), the last value that gets evaluated in the function body and isn’t stored as an object is what the function returns. (This is generally the last line without an assignment operator &lt;-.)\n\n\naverage3() is one example, but this can easily lead to errors.\nWe should explicitly return an object by putting it inside return().",

    "title": "9 Functions",
    "section": "Scope",
    "text": "Scope\nIn programming, scope refers to the area of a program where a named object is recognized and can be used.\n\nR uses lexical scoping, which means that the scope of a variable is determined by where it is created in the code.\n\nLexical scoping in R:\n\nWhen code refers to an object (e.g. data set, function, vector, etc.), R looks for the object in the current, local environment.\nIf it doesn’t find it, it continues to search by looking in the parent environment, and so on. The top-level environment is the global environment, the location where all interactive (i.e. outside of a function) computation and storage takes place.\n\nIf you save an object in R, outside a function local environment, it is stored in the global environment.\n\n\nIf R can’t find it in the global environment, it will look for it in loaded packages.\n\nWhen writing and using functions, the local environment is within the function itself.\n\nIf you define an object in the function, it won’t be accessible outside that function (unless you pass it as the output). See below:\n\n\nCodeaverage_new &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x)\n  fun_new_thing_within_function &lt;- \"Fun times!\"\n}\naverage_new(1:3)\nfun_new_thing_within_function\n\nError: object 'fun_new_thing_within_function' not found\n\n\nScoping is important to consider if you try to refer to objects that aren’t passed as arguments.\n\nThis can be dangerous because if you re-use names of variables, it is easy to accidentally refer to a variable that is not the one you intended. See below:\n\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new2 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n    sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) + v\n}\n\n\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 3 4 5\n\nCodev &lt;- c(4,5,6)\naverage_new2(1:3)\n\n[1] 6 7 8\n\n\nAnything created/saved/updated within a function that you want accessible outside that function needs to be passed to return(). See below:\n\nCodev &lt;- c(1,2,3)\n\naverage_new3 &lt;- function(x, remove_nas = TRUE) {\n  v &lt;- v + 10 # this is not changing v outside the function... \n  return(sum(x, na.rm = remove_nas)/length(x) )\n}\n\naverage_new3(1:3)\n\n[1] 2\n\nCodev\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nFor more about lexical scoping in R, see R Programming for Data Science",

The navigator oversees and provides guidance.\nFor the first exercise, the person whose birthday is coming up sooner will be the driver first. Swap role for the second exercise and continue in this manner for all exercises.\n\n\n\nRescaling function Write a function that rescales a numeric vector to be between 0 and 1. Here are some test cases with the expected output. Test out your function on the following inputs:\n\n\n\nx = 2:4. Expected output: 0.0 0.5 1.0\n\n\nx = c(-1, 0, 5). Expected output: 0.0000000 0.1666667 1.0000000\n\n\nx = -3:-1.

Your function should work on the following test cases: c(\"651-330-8661\", \"6516966000\", \"800 867 5309\").

(Pull up the documentation on ggplot with ?ggplot in the Console.) So the following doesn’t work:\n\nCodeggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price), diamonds) + geom_point()\n\nError in `ggplot()`:\n! `mapping` must be created by `aes()`.\n✖ You've supplied a tibble.\n\n\nBut if we named the arguments (name matching), we would be fine:\n\nCodeggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), data = diamonds) + geom_point()\n\n\nSomewhat confusingly, we can name some arguments and not others. Below, mapping is named, but data isn’t. This works because when an argument is matched by name, it is “removed” from the argument list, and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order that they are listed in the function definition.

    "text": "The if-else if-else Control Structure\nOften in functions, you will want to execute code chunks conditionally. In a programming language, control structures are parts of the language that allow you to control what code is executed. By far the most common is the `if-else if-else structure.\n\nCodeif (logical_condition) {\n    # some code\n} else if (other_logical_condition) {\n    # some code\n} else {\n    # some code\n}\n\nmiddle &lt;- function(x) {\n    mean_x &lt;- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n    median_x &lt;- median(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n    seems_skewed &lt;- (mean_x &gt; 1.5*median_x) | (mean_x &lt; (1/1.5)*median_x)\n    if (seems_skewed) {\n        median_x\n    } else {\n        mean_x\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo vectorize or not to vectorize\n\n\n\nThe if () else {} code is not vectorized; the logical condition in if() cannot be a logical vector of length longer than 1. If you want a vectorized version of conditional execution of code use if_else() or case_when(); these can be used in mutate().\n\n\nThe order of the arguments is first mapping and second data. The error is due to R thinking that census_data is supplying aesthetics. This is an example of positional matching gone wrong.\n\n\nConvert Temp Write a function for converting temperatures that takes as input a numeric value and a unit (either “C” for Celsius or “F” for Fahrenheit). The function should convert the temperature from one unit to the other based on the following formulas:\n\n\nTo convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: (Celsius * 9/5) + 32\n\nTo convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9\n\n\n\nCodeconvert_temp &lt;- function(temp, unit) {\n  if (unit==\"F\") {\n    (temp - 32) * 5/9\n  } else if (unit==\"C\") {\n    (temp * 9/5) + 32\n  }\n}\nconvert_temp(0, unit = \"C\")\n\n[1] 32\n\nCodeconvert_temp(32, unit = \"F\")\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n\nDomain Name Write a function that extracts the domain name of a supplied email address. The function should return the domain name (e.g., “gmail.com”). If the input is not a valid email address, return “Invalid Email”. (A valid email ends in “dot something”.)\n\n\nCodeextract_domain &lt;- function(email) {\n  is_valid &lt;- str_detect(email, \"@.+\\\\..+\")\n  if(is_valid) {\n    str_extract(email, \"@.+$\") |&gt; \n      str_remove(\"@\")\n  } else {\n    \"Invalid Email\"\n  }\n}\nextract_domain(email = \"les@mac.edu\")\n\n[1] \"mac.edu\"\n\nCodeextract_domain(email = \"les@mac.net\")\n\n[1] \"mac.net\"\n\nCodeextract_domain(email = \"les@mac.\")\n\n[1] \"Invalid Email\"\n\nCodeextract_domain(email = \"les@macedu\")\n\n[1] \"Invalid Email\"",

Must group by variables found in `.data`.\n✖ Column `group_var` is not found.\n\n\nWhat if the problem is that the variable names need to be in quotes?\n\nCodegroup_means(diamonds, group_var = \"cut\", mean_var = \"carat\")\n\nError in `group_by()`:\n! Must group by variables found in `.data`.\n✖ Column `group_var` is not found.\n\n\nWhat’s Going On?\nThe tidyverse uses something called tidy evaluation: this allows you to refer to a variable by typing it directly (e.g., no need to put it in quotes).\n\n\ngroup_by(group_var) is expecting a variable that is actually called group_var, and mean(mean_var) is expecting a variable that is actually called mean_var.\n\nTo fix this we need to embrace the variables inside the function with { var }:\n\nCodegroup_means &lt;- function(df, group_var, mean_var) {\n    df |&gt;\n        group_by({{ group_var }}) |&gt;\n        summarize(mean = mean({{ mean_var }}))\n}\n\n\nThe { var } tells R to look at what the variable specified by the input var rather than look for a variable called var.\n\nCodegroup_means(diamonds, group_var = cut, mean_var = carat)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  cut        mean\n  &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Fair      1.05 \n2 Good      0.849\n3 Very Good 0.806\n4 Premium   0.892\n5 Ideal     0.703\n\n\nLet’s group by both cut and color:\n\nCodegroup_means(diamonds, group_var = c(cut, color), mean_var = carat)\n\nError in `group_by()`:\nℹ In argument: `c(cut, color)`.\nCaused by error:\n! `c(cut, color)` must be size 53940 or 1, not 107880.\n\n\nOh No! What Now?!\nWhen c(cut, color) is put inside { c(cut, color) } within the function, R is actually running the code inside { }.\n\nThis combines the columns for those 2 variables into one long vector. What we really meant by c(cut, color) is “group by both cut and color”.\n\nTo fix this, we need the pick() function to get R to see { group_var } as a vector of separate variables (like the way select() works).\n\nCodegroup_means &lt;- function(df, group_var, mean_var) {\n    df |&gt;\n        group_by(pick({{ group_var }})) |&gt;\n        summarize(mean = mean({{ mean_var }}))\n}\n\n\n\n\nProp function Create a new version of dplyr::count() that also shows proportions instead of just sample sizes. The function should be able to handle counting by multiple variables. Test your function with two different sets of arguments using the diamonds dataset.\n\n\n\nScatterplot + Smooth function Create a function that creates a scatterplot from a user-supplied dataset with user-supplied x and y variables. The plot should also show a curvy smoothing line in blue, and a linear smoothing line in red. Test your function using the diamonds dataset.",

A vector of positive integers.\n\n\nSubsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Vectors # x &lt;- c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\") # x[c(3, 2, 5)] # x[2:4] # class(x[2:4]) # result is a character vector #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Lists # y &lt;- list(a = 1:3, b = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), c = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)) # y[c(1, 2)] #  # class(y[c(1)]) # result is a list #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy repeating a position, you can actually make a longer output than input, making the term “subsetting” a bit of a misnomer.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Vector # x[c(1, 1, 2)] #  # # List # y[c(1, 1, 2)] #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. A vector of negative integers.\n\n\nNegative values drop the elements at the specified positions:\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Vector # x[c(-1, -3, -5)] #  # # List # y[c(-1)] #  #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A logical vector.\n\n\nSubsetting with a logical vector only keeps values corresponding to TRUE.\n\n\nThis is generally used with comparison functions and operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Vector # x &lt;- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA) #  # # All non-missing values of x # x[!is.na(x)] #  # # All values greater than 5, with NAs # x[x &gt; 5] #      # # All non-missing values greater than 5 # x[x &gt; 5 & !is.na(x)] #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike filter(), NA indices will be included in the output as NAs unless you explicitly remove them (filter() removes instances of missing values by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r}     # # # Compare with filter  # # filter(tibble(x = x), x &gt; 5) #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # List # y[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] # y[y |&gt; map_lgl(~ is.numeric(.x))] # example of a map function! # y[y |&gt; map_lgl(~ is.character(.x))] #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. A character vector.\n\n\nIf you have a named vector or list, you can subset it with a character vector:\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # # Named Vector # x &lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5) # x[c(\"xyz\", \"def\")] # x[c(\"xyz\",\"xyz\",\"xyz\", \"def\")] #  # #Named List # y[c('a','a','c')] #\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with subsetting with positive integers, you can use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe very wary of vector recycling when doing this!\n\n\nThe number of things that you’re inserting should either be 1 or the size of the x[i] subset.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # x &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\") # x #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # x[c(1, 3)] &lt;- \"new\" # Replacement length is 1 # x #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # x &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\") # x[c(1, 3)] &lt;- c(\"new1\", \"new2\") # Replacement length is 2, and length of subset is 2 # x #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # x &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\") # x[c(1, 3, 4)] &lt;- c(\"new1\", \"new2\") # BAD! Replacement length is 2, and length of subset is 3 # x #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # x &lt;- c(first = \"one\", second = \"two\", third = \"three\", fourth = \"four\") # x[c(1, 3)] &lt;- c(\"new1\", \"new2\", \"new3\") # BAD! Replacement length is 3, and length of subset is 2 # x #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Subsetting Matricies and Data Frames with [\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above subsetting options can be used for subsetting matrices and data frames (named list of elements of equal length).\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # m &lt;- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4) # m #  # m[1:5] # Matrix = vector (down the columns) with dimensions #\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a comma to subset by rows and columns separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # m[1,] # Get 1st row # m[,1] # Get 1st column #\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # m[1,3] # Get 1st row and 3rd column #  # m[c(1,3),] # Get 1st and 3rd rows # m[,c(1,3)] # Get 1st and 3rd columns # m[c(1,3),c(1,3)] # Get 1st and 3rd rows and 1st and 3rd columns #  # m[-1,] # Get all rows except 1st # m[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),] # Get the 1st row via a logical #  #  # # Add row and column names to the matrix # colnames(m) &lt;- str_c(\"col\", 1:4) # rownames(m) &lt;- str_c(\"row\", 1:3) # m[\"row1\",] #  #\n\n\n\n\n\n## Selecting a single element with $ and [[\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use $ and [[ to extract a single column of a data frame or an element within a list.

CI Function Write a function that fits a linear model on the dataset using the given outcome and predictor variables and return a data frame (tibble) with the coefficient estimate and CI for the predictor of interest. It should take the following inputs:\n\n\n\n\n\n- data: A dataset\n\n\n- yvar: Outcome variable to be used in a linear model (a length-1 character vector)\n\n\n- preds: Predictor variables to be used in a linear model (a character vector)\n\n\n- pred_of_interest: The variable whose coefficient estimate and confidence interval are of interest (a length-1 character vector and should be one of preds)\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment tip: As you develop, it will help to create objects for the arguments so that you can see what output looks like interactively:\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your function on the mtcars dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r eval=FALSE} # data &lt;- mtcars # yvar &lt;- \"mpg\" # preds &lt;- c(\"hp\", \"wt\") # pred_of_interest &lt;- \"hp\" #\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you’re done developing your function, remove these objects to declutter your environment by entering rm(data, yvar, preds, pred_of_interest) in the Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n{r eval=FALSE} # fit_mod_and_extract &lt;- function(___) { #     # Use str_c to create a string (formula_str) that looks like \"yvar ~ pred1 + pred2\" #     # Look at the documentation for a helpful argument #     mod_formula_str &lt;-  #     mod_form &lt;- as.formula(mod_formula_str) #      #     # Fit a linear model using the constructed formula and given data #     mod &lt;- lm(mod_form, data = data) #      #     # Obtain 95% confidence interval #     ci &lt;- confint(mod, level = 0.95) #      #     # Return the coefficient estimate and CI for the predictor of interest #     tibble( #         which_pred = pred_of_interest, #         estimate = ___, #         ci_lower = ___, #         ci_upper = ___ #     ) # } #\n\n\n\n\n\n{r} # library(stringr) # fit_mod_and_extract &lt;- function(data, yvar, preds, pred_of_interest) { #     # Use str_c to create a string (formula_str) that looks like \"yvar ~ pred1 + pred2\" #     # Look at the documentation for a helpful argument #     mod_formula_str &lt;-  #       mod_form &lt;- as.formula(mod_formula_str) #      #     # Fit a linear model using the constructed formula and given data #     mod &lt;- lm(mod_form, data = data) #      #     # Obtain 95% confidence interval #     ci &lt;- confint(mod, level = 0.95) #      #     # Return the coefficient estimate and CI for the predictor of interest #     tibble( #         which_pred = pred_of_interest, #         estimate = mod$coefficients[pred_of_interest], #         ci_lower = ci[pred_of_interest, \"2.5%\"], #         ci_upper = ci[pred_of_interest, \"97.5%\"] #     ) # } # fit_mod_and_extract(data = mtcars, yvar = \"mpg\", preds = c(\"hp\", \"wt\"), pred_of_interest = \"hp\") #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Debugging Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing functions and working with functions that you wrote, you may encounter errors that are hard to figure out.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some strategies to help you debug the issues you encounter:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Use print() and cat() to print out intermediate results and messages within a function.\n\n\n- Examples: print(x), cat(\"The value of x is\", x, \"\\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n{r eval=FALSE} # My_own_sum &lt;- function(x){ #   print(x) #   return(sum(x)) # } # My_own_sum(c(1,2,3)) #  # My_own_sum &lt;- function(x){ #   cat(\"The value of x is\", x, \"\\n\") #   cat(\"The class of x is\", class(x), \"\\n\") #   return(sum(x)) # } #  # My_own_sum(c(1,2,3)) #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Use browser() to pause the function at a certain point and interactively explore the environment.

For example, on the NIH News Releases page, we can see that the data is represented in a consistent pattern of image + title + abstract.\nWe will identify data in a web page using a pattern matching language called CSS Selectors that can refer to specific patterns in HTML, the language used to write web pages.\nFor example:\n\nSelecting by element/tag type:\n\n\n\"a\" selects all hyperlinks in a webpage (“a” represents “anchor” links in HTML)\n\n\"p\" selects all paragraph elements\n\n\nSelecting by class and ID:\n\n\n\".description\" selects all elements with class equal to “description”\n\nThe . at the beginning is what signifies class selection.\nThis is one of the most common CSS selectors for scraping because in HTML, the class attribute is extremely commonly used to format webpage elements. (Any number of HTML elements can have the same class, which is not true for the id attribute.)\n\n\n\n\"#mainTitle\" selects the SINGLE element with id equal to “mainTitle”\n\nThe # at the beginning is what signifies id selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\nWarning: Websites change often! So if you are going to scrape a lot of data, it is probably worthwhile to save and date a copy of the website (File &gt; Save As). Otherwise, you may return after some time and your scraping code will include all of the wrong CSS selectors.\nAlthough you can learn how to use CSS Selectors by hand (CSS Selectors), we will use a shortcut by installing the Selector Gadget tool.\n\nThere is a version available for Chrome–add it to Chrome via the Chome Web Store.\n\nMake sure to pin the extension to the menu bar. (Click the 3 dots &gt; Extensions &gt; Manage extensions. Click the “Details” button under SelectorGadget and toggle the “Pin to toolbar” option.)\n\n\nThere is also a version that can be saved as a bookmark in the browser–see here.\n\nLet’s watch the Selector Gadget tutorial video before proceeding.",

    "text": "SQL Practice\nStack Exchange Data Explorer\nWe will experiment with the Stack Exchange Data Explorer, a website that provides a SQL interface for all the data in StackExchange.\nStackExchange powers the StackOverflow programming question and answer site, but it also powers question and answer sites related to 126 topics including English, Travel, Bicycles, and Parenting.\nStackExchange provides an in-depth Data Explorer Tutorial. We start with this interface to construct SQL queries on the Travel Data Explorer.\nInstructions\nHead to the Stack Exchange Data Explorer for Travel.\nYou will see a list of queries other users have created in the past. These queries are for all Stack Exchange sites, so some may not be relevant. Queries about your activity (for example, “How many upvotes do I have for each tag?”) will not be useful either if you do not have activity for the particular site.\nClick on one of them and you see the SQL code for the query.\nThen click the “Run Query” button to get results.\nFor example, you might look at the number of up vs down votes for questions and answers by weekday and notice that for questions, Tuesday has the highest up vs. down vote ratio and Saturday has the lowest. You can contemplate hypotheses for this difference!\nSelect Queries\nLet’s experiment with our own queries.\nClick on “Compose Query” in the upper right, and notice the tables are shown in the right.\nAs a reminder, a table is similar to a data frame.\n\nEach table lists the columns stored within the table and the data types for the columns.\nLook through the tables for Posts, Users, and Comments.\nDo the columns generally make sense, and correspond to the StackOverflow website?\n\nThere’s a description of the tables and columns (called a schema) available on StackExchange’s Meta Q&A Site.\nNow enter your first query in the text box and click the “Run Query” button:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100) Id, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\n\n\nIn this query we already see several important features of SQL:\n\n\nSELECT tells SQL that a query is coming.\n\nTOP(100) only returns the first 100 rows.\n\nNote: The StackExchange data explorer uses a variant of SQL called Transact SQL that is supported by Microsoft databases. TOP(100) is a non-standard SQL feature supported by T-SQL. For most databases you would accomplish the same goal by adding LIMIT 100 to the end of the query.\n\n\n\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags determines what columns are included in the result\n\nFROM Posts determines the source dataset.\n\nFrom glancing at the results, it appears that this table contains both questions and answers.\nLet’s try to focus on answers.\nLooking again at the Schema Description, notice that there is a PostTypeId column in Posts, and a value of 1 corresponds to questions.\nLet’s update our query to only include questions:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\n\n\nThe SQL command WHERE is like the filter command we have been using in dplyr.\n\nNote that whereas we used the double equals == for comparison in R, the SQL WHERE command takes just a single =.\n\nExercise: Find the title and score of Posts that have a score of at least 110. Hint: TOP is not necessary here because you want all result rows.\n\nCode\n\n\nExercise: Find posts whose title contains some place you are interested in (you pick!). Hint: use SQL’s LIKE operator.\n\nCode\n\n\nNote that you can look up the actual webpage for any question using its Id.\nFor example, if the Id is 19591, the webpage URL would be https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19591/. Look up a few of the questions by their Id.\nIt’s unclear how the 100 questions we saw were selected from among the over 43,000 total questions.\n\nTo count the number of posts, we can use COUNT in SQL: SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM Posts Where PostTypeId = 1.\n\nLet’s try to arrange the Posts by score.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\nORDER BY Score DESC\n\n\nThe ORDER BY ??? DESC syntax is similar to R’s arrange(). You can leave off the DESC if you want the results ordered smallest to largest.\nWe could also find the highest rated questions tagged “italy”:\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nId, Title, Score, Body, Tags\nFROM Posts\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1 AND Tags LIKE '%italy%'\nORDER BY Score DESC\n\n\nExercise: Pick two tags that interest you and you think will occur together and find the top voted posts that contain both.\n\nCode\n\n\nSQL Summarization\nSo far, we have covered the equivalent of R’s selecting, filtering, and arranging.\nLet’s take a look at grouping and summarizing now, which has similar structures in both R and SQL. Imagine we want to see how many posts of each type there are. This query shows us that there are 44K questions and 71K answers.\n\nCodeSELECT \nPostTypeId, COUNT(Id) numPosts\nFROM posts\nGROUP BY PostTypeId \nORDER BY PostTypeId\n\n\nNote two characteristics of SQL summarization here:\n\nThe GROUP BYclause indicates the table column for grouping, much like R’s group_by.\nThere is no explicit summarize. Instead, all columns that appear in the SELECT except for those listed in GROUP BY must make use of an aggregate function. COUNT(*) is one of these, and is the equivalent of R’s n(). Many other aggregate functions exist, including MAX, SUM, AVG, and many others. Every aggregate function requires a column as an argument (even COUNT() which doesn’t logically need one).\nThe aggregate column (in this case COUNT(Id)) must immediately be followed by a name that will be used for it in the results (in this case numPosts). This can be particularly useful if you want to order by the aggregated value.\n\nExercise: Change the previous query so it orders the result rows by the number of posts of that type. Hint: Reuse the name you assigned to the aggregate function.\nExercise: Find the most commonly used tagsets (sets/combinations of tags) applied to posts. Note that this is not asking you to count the most common individual tags — this would be more complex because multiple tags are squashed into the Tags field.\nSQL Joins\nFinally, as with R, we often want to join data from two or more tables. The types of joins in SQL are the same as we saw with R (inner, outer, left, right). Most commonly we want to perform an INNER join, which is the default if you just say JOIN. (We can look up the inner_join() documentation to remind ourselves what an inner join does.)\nLet’s say we wanted to enhance the earlier query to find the highest scoring answers with some information about each user.\n\nCodeSELECT TOP(100)\nTitle, Score, DisplayName, Reputation\nFROM Posts p\nJOIN Users u\nON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id\nWHERE PostTypeId = 1\nORDER BY Score Desc\n\n\nWe see a few notable items here:\n\nThe JOIN keyword must go in between the two tables we want to join.\nEach table must be named. In this case we named posts p and users u.\nWe need to specify the relationship that joins the two tables. In this case, a posts OwnerUserId column refers to the Id column in the users table.\n\nExercise: Create a query similar to the one above that identifies the authors of the top rated comments instead of posts.\nIf you want more practice, go to https://mystery.knightlab.com/.",
