## Instructions

**Task:** Open up the New York Times article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html), and scroll down to the plot titled "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades (Share of the work force in a union, by industry)".

![](https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-f25/images/challenge-2-goal.png)

Using `ggplot2` and other tools in R, recreate this plot. Note that you will need to create the data underlying the plot yourself. You can create this data in R with `tibble()`. You can also write the data in Excel or Google Sheets and export it as a CSV file.

**Requirements:**

- Overall
  - Panels for "All workers", "By Sector", and "By Industry" are shown.
  - Arrows showing the change from 1983 to 2022 are shown.
    - Note: be sure that the arrows all point in the correct direction!
  - The actual percentages in 1983 and 2022 are shown as text.
  - X-axis tick marks are at 0, 25, and 50.
  - Plot title says "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades".
  - Plot subtitle says "Share of the work force in a union, by industry".
- Resource reflection
    - At least 1 resource is listed
    - At least 3 sentences about resources and their helpfulness in the task

**Bonus**: Additional possibilities to enhance your visualization include adjusting the default aesthetics of the arrows, aligning your plots neatly, and adding margins in order to left-align the y-axis text. 





## Setup

```{r}
# Code for loading packages
# And code for reading in data if using the Excel/Google Sheets-->CSV approach
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Code for generating the data (if using the tibble() approach)
union_data <- tibble(
  category = c(
    "All workers",
    "Private sector", "Public sector",
    "Transportation and utilities", "Manufacturing", "Mining", "Construction",
    "Education and health", "Arts, entertainment and recreation",
    "Business services", "Retail, food and hospitality",
    "Public administration", "Agriculture"
  ),
  start_year = c(1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983, 1983),
  end_year   = c(2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022, 2022),
  start_val  = c(20, 17, 37, 47, 28, 27, 28, 26, 17, 10, 8, 30, 5),
  end_val    = c(10, 6, 33, 16, 8, 7, 13, 17, 7, 3, 3, 28, 4)
)

```




## Visualization


```{r}
# Code for recreating the visualization
# Use as many code chunks as you need to organize your work well
ggplot(union_data) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = end_val, xend = start_val,
                   y = reorder(category, start_val),
                   yend = reorder(category, start_val)),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm"), ends = "last", type = "closed"),
               color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = start_val, y = category, label = start_val), 
            hjust = -0.2, size = 3.2) +
  geom_text(aes(x = end_val, y = category, label = end_val), 
            hjust = 1.2, size = 3.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50), breaks = seq(0, 50, 25), labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades",
    subtitle = "Share of the work force in a union, by industry",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9)
  )
```



## Resources Reflection (required)

List the resources you used to help with this assignment then write 3-5 sentence reflection on which resources were most helpful in finishing this task.

**Resources:**

- Previous ICA
- ggplot documentation

**Reflection:**

For this assignment, I relied on a mix of class notes, R documentation, and online examples of ggplot2 visualizations. The documentation was especially helpful for remembering how to use geom_segment() and customizing arrows, while my previous in-class work gave me confidence in structuring the code into clean chunks. Creating the dataset myself was a useful exercise in carefully translating a figure into underlying data. Overall, the combination of class resources and external references made the process much smoother and more manageable.
