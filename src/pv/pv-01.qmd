# Brainstorming: Spotify Professional Visualization

Possible Focus Ideas:
- What characteristics popular songs share
- How music features differ across genres
- Whether happy/upbeat songs are more popular
- How musical features have changed over time

Key Variables to Use (will choose ~4–6):
- Outcome: popularity
- Audio features: danceability, energy, valence (mood), tempo, loudness, acousticness
- Context: genre, release year, duration, artist

Guiding Questions:
- Which musical features are most associated with popularity?
- Do certain genres have specific “sound profiles”?
- Are popular songs happier/faster/more energetic?
- Have hit songs changed over time in tempo or mood?

Visualization Ideas:
- Scatterplot with encodings: e.g., danceability vs. energy, color = popularity
- Small multiples: genre or time comparisons
- Density/ridgeline plots: compare feature distributions for high vs. low popularity songs
- Line + annotations: trends in features across years

Style Inspiration (NYT-style):
- Clear title + subtitle explaining insight
- Minimal legend, clean color use
- Annotations pointing out key observations
- Labels that make plot easy to read without extra text

Data Tasks:
- Clean genre names if needed
- Create popularity groups (e.g., top 10%, mid, low)
- Possibly scale/normalize features
- Remove missing or irrelevant rows

Hypotheses to Explore:
- Popular songs tend to be more danceable and moderately energetic
- Modern hits may be slower and sadder than older hits
- Genres have distinct sound patterns
